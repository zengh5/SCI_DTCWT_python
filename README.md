# History
After the publication, we received numerous requests on the python implementation on DWT/DTCWT-based camera identification. To this end, we prepare this project this year and make it public for the researchers' convenience.

## Disclaimer notice ##
    We public this code solely for the convenience of researchers to reproduce our idea accurately and rapidly. Hence, it is for academic use only.
    Some of the codes are modified based on the public codes of Prof. Ivan Selesnick (http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/) and DDE lab(http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/). 'dtcwt' package is copied from ''https://dtcwt.readthedocs.io/en/0.12.0/index.html''
    We thank their contributions and please cite the original work if you find the codes are useful.
